* When writing RSpecs always follow betterspecs guides (<http://www.betterspecs.org/>), including:
  * Use descriptive contexts and example names
  * Use `let` and `subject` appropriately
  * Use `describe` for classes and `context` for different states
  * Write one expectation per example
  * Use `before` blocks sparingly
  * Use `shared_examples` for common behavior
* It is `and_return` **not** `and.return`
